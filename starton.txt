Hi Francois,

Thank you for your email. 

We are just waiting for our lawyers to send us the agreement. It should be with you in the next few days. 

Laracasts website is a good resource for learning Laravel. I have listed below some resources you can use to learn. Please note that you may be already familiar with many of these concepts however it is good to refresh your memory.

I would personally recommend by starting with the following courses:

https://laracasts.com/series/php-for-beginners
https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/
https://www.w3schools.com/js/

Once you have completed the above try:

https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-from-scratch-2017/ (there are about 32 episode under this - would take about 5 hours in total)
https://laracasts.com/lessons/laravel-5-and-behat-bffs
https://laracasts.com/series/how-to-be-awesome-in-phpstorm

You can revise by watching:
https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-5-fundamentals

Once you have completed the above please try the following:

https://laracasts.com/series/search-as-a-service/

Then you can try to create a demo Stripe payment project using:

https://stripe.com/docs/api/php#intro

These should enable you to complete the task for us.
